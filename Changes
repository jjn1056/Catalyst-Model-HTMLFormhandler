  - Injection new form model ::IsValid that returns the form only if its valid
    and undef otherwise.

  - Tweaks to how set set and guess a target action for a form if you do not
    provide one.
  - ALlows you to set an action attribute "FormModelTarget($form_model)" in an
    action in the current controller to set that as the form target action.  This
    is considered experimental.

  - When calling the model for the second and more times after creating it,
    pass any args (if any) to ->process.
  - When calling for the model you may now use a single first positioned argument
    to set the item or item_id, to cover a common use case.
  - Allow you to control if we use Request->body_data or Request->body_parameters
    when accessing POSTed data.
  - Allow you to disable form auto process of request body globally.
